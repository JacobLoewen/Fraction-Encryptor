# Fraction-Encryptor
Takes any sentence using ASCII characters ranging from hex values 20 to 7E (or decimal values 32 to 126) and converts it into three integers. These integers can then be used to decrypt the sentence.

Here is the purpose of each integer:
1. The Numerator
2. The Denominator
3. The Size of the Sentence

By dividing the numerator and denominator, a decimal number (potentially infinite) will form, storing any sentence desired.
